 * Project:      Foosball Table Scoreboard with a Smart Single Player Mode
 *
 * Description:  This is a self-directed project to design and implement a digital score board
 *               system with support for two player and single player game modes.
 *               The two player game mode represents a digital version of typical game
 *               play with the additional ability to increment score using buttons,
 *               reset button functionality, and photo electric sensors for goal
 *               detection. The single player mode uses the left button and
 *               photoelectric sensor to increment the user's score. The right button
 *               is used to begin computer scoring, in which a real opponent's scoring
 *               is simulated. The first to 10 wins.
